## Laravel OnlineStore

Online Store is a web application where users place orders to buy products.

• Home page will display a welcome message and some images.
• About page will display information about the online store and developers.
• Products page will display the available products information. In addition, you can click on a specific product
and see its information.
• Cart page will display the products added to the cart and the total price to be paid. In addition, a user can
remove products from the cart and make purchases.
• Login page will display a form to allow users to log in to the application.
• Register page will display a form to allow users to sign up for accounts.
• My orders page will display the orders placed by the logged in user.
• Admin panel will contain sections to manage the store’s products (create, update, delete, and list them).
The Online Store will be implemented with Laravel (PHP), MySQL database, Bootstrap (a CSS framework), and
Blade (a Laravel templating system).
